    <p>
        It's a Cold War tale of the "Typhoon" class missile submarine Krasniy Oktyabr (Russian: Red October). The sub
        has an experimentai magnetohydrodynamic propulsion system (referred to as the caterpillar drive), which allows
        it to run more quietly than any other ship at sea; effectively making it nigh-invisible to (passive) SONAR
        detection. It's manned by a Soviet Submarine Captain Marko Ramius, and confronted by one of Tom Clancy's popular
        character, CIA agent Jack Ryan. Agent Ryan must help Captain Ramius after proving that he's going to defect to
        the United States with his members on board of the Red October.
