    <h4>8/10 Very, very good submarine movie -TheLittleSongbird 6 February 2009</h4>
    <p>
        Don't get me wrong, this is actually a very good movie. And this is coming from a 16 year old schoolgirl! It is
        fast paced, not too long, and while the story is a bit confusing sometimes, it is one of the few movies that
        maintains our attention all the way through. Director John McTiernon ensures that the tension rarely slips, and
        is fairly faithful to the novel, which needs a great deal of understanding especially in the descriptions of the
        submarines. Though some of the characters especially Dr Petrov have a more significant role in the book.
        Speaking of the character, many said that 43-year old Tim Curry of Clue fame, looked young and that it was
        insane casting. He was only in 15 minutes of the movie, but he is so important, and I was impressed by the depth
        of Curry's performance, it's different to any other role he's played, and how the character turned out in
        general. As well as the submarine and the odd visuals, the music was phenomenal as well as the look of the film
        and the sound, with a conveniently Russian feel to it. It was also very musical with what was going on. The
        acting is what holds the film together, with a charismatic performance from Sean Connery,(in one of his best
        post-Bond roles) and a career best from Alec Baldwin. Sam Neill also gives a moving performance, as well as the
        ever-excellent James Earl Jones, who is in my sister's favourite film the Lion King. I recommend this movie
        highly, if you're a fan of Tom Clancy. I'm not, but I enjoyed it, because I like films that are tense and I like
        a lot of the actors in the film. 8.5/10. Bethany Cox

    <h4>10/10 Seen it 8 times -- and it never gets old -A_Different_Drummer 2 March 2015</h4>
    <p>
        Let's talk about some of the things that make a movie a classic. Acting? Check. Just look at the stars. Script?
        Check. Based on book by Clancy back when people read books (and dinosaurs walked) and Clancy OWNED his niche.
        Cinematography? Direction? That it takes place on a sub means it is distinctive and memorable from the getgo.
        Something about the claustrophobia of a submarine reflected in the claustrophobia of a movie theatre. Most of
        important of all is the pacing. There are few films that I have seen this many times and the reason is that the
        story builds so beautifully. With such a great payoff. Story telling at its finest. So tricks, so attempt to
        sucker punch the viewer, not even any pretty girls to distract from the weak scenes. Because there are none. a
        classic. And under-rated.

    <h4>The Best of the Jack Ryan Films... -MovieAddict2016 18 May 2003</h4>
    <p>
        "The Hunt for Red October" is taken off of military-expert Tom Clancy's gripping novel. Tom Clancy has a knack
        for the inner-psyche of our fears. He doesn't openly thrill us, but rather opens our minds to the potential
        hazards in the US government. Most government/military thrillers skim the surface and gather us a few good
        things to make us go, "Whoo," but Tom Clancy's books make us fall over in amazement. The man has an incredible
        knowledge of the government and its subsidaries, and his novels show this. His film adaptations normally make
        good. All four are at least good, and one of them, "The Hunt for Red October," is taut, tense, and powerfully
        moving. The plot of the film is fictional, but it is right out of the headlines. It is about a submarine, a
        Russian, and an American. It sounds like the setup for a bar-joke, but it's not. The Russian man is named Ramius
        (Sean Connery), who, along with his crew, takes a Soviet submarine out to the North Atlantic ocean. The sub is
        the best-of-the-best, with an all-new propolsion system (it's faster than other submarines), and uses advanced
        techniques to literally disappear off radar. After a few days out at sea, the submarine vanishes off radar, and
        the Russians, frantic, tell the American government that Ramius has taken the sub to America's mainland to
        launch a missile attack. However, CIA Analyst Jack Ryan (Alec Baldwin) thinks otherwise. He believes Ramius is
        defecting to the States along with his crew. Further, he believes the Russians don't want to admit this for fear
        of losing their best submarine. The film is directed by John McTiernan, who brought us "Predator," "Die Hard,"
        "The Thomas Crown Affair" (remake) and "Die Hard with a Vengeance." All of the preceding films are very good,
        most of them great, and "The Hunt for Red October" qualifies as "very good." Sean Connery gives a commanding
        performance as the leading character, Ramius. His second-hand-man is played by Sam Neil, faking a Russian accent
        very badly. But Neil is lovable in his role, despite having the worst Russian accent ever. Tim Curry joins along
        for the ride on the misfortuned sub as well, and Alec Baldwin gives his best performance as Jack Ryan. As much
        as I don't like to admit it, Harrison Ford isn't the ideal Jack Ryan for me. He differs too much from the
        character in the novel. Neither Ben Affleck nor Alec Baldwin take the cake, either. But if you look past the
        book persona, you will enjoy the performances in all the films much more. I don't tend to like military
        thrillers most of the time. Most likely because they are put together sloppily on the whole. But "The Hunt for
        Red October" isn't sloppy, careless, nor boring. It's thrilling, exciting, and entertaining. But the book is
        better. 4/5 stars - John Ulmer

    <h4>9/10 A surprisingly action filled submarine movie. -Boba_Fett1138 12 March 2005</h4>
    <p>
        Yes, it sounds like a weird combination. A submarine movie with exciting action. Still "The Hunt for Red
        October" is a movie filled with some superb underwater action sequence's that were brilliantly directed by
        action movie veteran John McTiernan. The underwater finale is really 'edge-of-your-seat' stuff! With this movie
        McTiernan shows once more that he is the best action movie director alive, along with James Cameron. Still the
        movie has more to offer than just action. The story is also what makes this an excellent political thriller,
        making this movie perfectly watchable for both the action movie lovers and those of political thrillers. Of all
        the Tom Clancy novel movies this is my personal favorite and best so far. The cast consists out of some big
        names. Connery is great as Russian submarine captain who talks Russian with a Scotish accent. Alec Baldwin is a
        wonderful Jack Ryan. Other actors that stood out to me were; Sam Neill, Tim Curry, Stellan Skarsg√•rd, Jeffrey
        Jones and Scott Glenn. Only too bad about the Beaumont character, that was just annoying and unnecessary. The
        phenomenal cinematography was done by Jan de Bont. The likewise phenomenal music was composed by Basil
        Poledouris who's name I can't still spell right without having to look it up. Poledouris truly is a criminally
        underrated composer and with this movie he once again delivers a true masterpiece. It's the combination of all
        these great things that make "The Hunt for Red October" a brilliant and tad underrated movie, that is perfectly
        watchable for a wide range of people. 9/10

    <h4>The captain of all submarine movies -WalterFrith 22 January 2005</h4>
    <p>
        Because of the intrigue this film offers, the circumstances involved tie up neatly in a very convincing way.
        Needing all of the variables to fall into place if his defection hopes to be successful, Soviet (although
        Lithuanian by birth) submarine Captain Ramius (Sean Connery) is a very worthy submarine captain. Never cracking
        under pressure and carrying out his duty professionally, Ramius is the perfect ally to the west in keeping the
        balance between the super powers in their military endeavours. Alec Baldwin is good as Jack Ryan. I wish he had
        stayed on as this character in 'Patriot Games' and 'Clear and Present Danger', because although I like Harrison
        Ford better as a movie star/actor, Baldwin just seemed better for this role. Too bad he left. Director John
        McTiernan uses a smooth pace and lets the screenplay speak louder than his role as the man in charge of it all
        and the film's photography is tense along with the editing and sound. An Oscar winner for sound effects editing,
        'The Hunt for Red October' will put a submarine in your living room if you have the DVD 5.1. surround sound.
        It's positively realistic!
