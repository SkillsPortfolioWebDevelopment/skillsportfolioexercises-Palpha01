    <h1>FOR HONOR</h1>
    <h2>"We all die, some live forever..."</h2>

    <p>
        For Honor is a real-time reaction/strategy game developed by Ubisoft Montreal for Playstation 4, XBOX One, and
        PC.
        The factions set in the world of Heathmoor originally known as The Legion, The Chosen, and The Warborn are known
        as Knights, Samurai, and Vikings respectively.
        With the addition of the Marching Fire DLC and the arrival of Year 6, two new factions arrived known as the Wu
        Lin and the Outlanders.

    <h3>Hero Types</h3>

    <p>
        Each five factions so far have their own heroes. Each of the heroes comes with their own set of skills, weapons,
        armor, and fighting style
        and are grouped into one of four types. They are:
    </p>

    <pre>
        路 Vanguards - These are well-balanced heroes with good attack and defense capabilities. They also have good
        versatility, and make good heroes for fresh players to start with.

        路 Assassins - This hero type is swift and lethal. They have good offensive skills in trade of limited defensive
        options.

        路 Heavies - These heroes have the highest resistance to damage but their attacks are slower than other types,
        although still deadly. They are best used for playing on the defense.

        路 Hybrids - Hybrids are a mix of the other three types, making them a little more difficult to master due to
        their unique use of tactics,
        but they are no less effective in killing for the player willing to make the effort.
    </pre>

    <h3>Knights</h3>

    <p>
        The Knights are one of the five playable factions in For Honor. It is their belief that many, if not all of the
        ancient ruins were constructed by their ancestors. The Knights had been scattered for centuries but have begun
        to reunite under a single banner, that of the Iron Legion. There are those still, however, who choose to gather
        their own "Legion", and their alliance with the Iron Legion is shaky at best.

    <h3>Samurai</h3>

    <p>
        The Samurai of the Dawn Empire is one of the five playable factions in For Honor. These people come from a land,
        far to the East and they tell a tale of a homeland and an Emperor that were lost to sea and fire during the
        great cataclysm. Now, more than a millennia later the nomadic warriors roam no more and have rebuilt themselves
        in a new land with a new Emperor. After having been driven from their ancestral homes and rebuilding their
        forces, though strong and mighty, the Samurai still find themselves vastly outnumbered by their new neighbors.
        Because of this, they know that only through greater cunning, skill and loyalty to each other will their people
        have a chance to thrive. They may very well be the last of their kind.

    <h3>Vikings</h3>

    <p>
        The Vikings are one of the five playable factions in For Honor. Previously thought to have vanished, the Vikings
        have returned in great numbers from across the sea. They have come to take new lands, plunder, expand the
        clans and reclaim their ancient homeland in the North. Hundreds of clans now dominate amidst the cold and icy
        tundra. The Vikings are the undisputed power of the rivers and seas. In their pursuit to gain the approval of
        their gods in Valhalla, the Vikings live for battle and glory as they seek out riches and new land, destroying
        everything in their path to gain it.
    </p>

    <h3>Wu Lin</h3>

    <p>
        The Wu Lin is one of the five playable factions in For Honor. They are made up of warriors from ancient China,
        who now travel west seeking vengeance from war, betrayal, and personal tragedies. After The Cataclysm, China
        descended into hundreds of years of civil war. Of all the factions partaking in the
        civil war, the Wu Lin have begun to rise to the top. But even they have begun to splinter after so many years of
        conflict. Many of their warriors have begun to travel west, each with their own reason ranging from honor and
        glory to exile and disgrace.
    </p>

    <h3>Outlanders</h3>

    <p>
        The Outlanders is the fifth playable faction in For Honor. Unlike the four other factions though, the Heroes of
        this faction are free adventurers who have no cultural links between each other. They fight for those who are
        loyal to them or who pay them well. As explorers and adventurers, they bring relics and treasures to Heathmoor
        from mysterious lands, with the Pirate being the first to showcase this to our fellow warriors to establish a
        connection between Heathmoor and this new group of Heroes. While no one knows how the great cataclysm has
        affected these wanderers, some of them may have a history with the existing factions while others have come only
        now because of a newfound connection.
